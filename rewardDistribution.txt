rewardPerToken Function Math Explanation
The rewardPerToken function calculates how many reward tokens are earned per staked token over time. Here's the mathematical logic:

The Formula
```
rewardPerTokenStored + (((block.timestamp - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRate * 1e8) / totalStaked)
```
Breakdown
Base Concept: This function tracks accumulated rewards per single staked token.

Components:

rewardPerTokenStored: Previously accumulated rewards per token
block.timestamp - lastUpdateTime: Time elapsed (in seconds) since last update
rewardRate: Rate of reward distribution (tokens per second)
totalStaked: Total amount of tokens staked in the contract
1e8: Scaling factor (10^8) to handle decimal precision
Calculation Process:

First calculates new rewards generated since last update: (block.timestamp - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRate
Scales by 10^8 for decimal precision
Divides by totalStaked to get per-token amount
Adds to the previous accumulated rewards
Edge Case: If totalStaked = 0, returns previous value to avoid division by zero
